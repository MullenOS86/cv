        and paste in between quotations in the image tag. Now if the browser doesnt show the image, then you and you the "alt"
        attribute and type what the picture was in the quotations. This also help you when someone is searching for something
        related to your website.(2) Drag and drop image that i have saved on my computer or copy and paste in "html-personal site" folder.
        Then type the name of the picture in between the "src" parentheses.(3) Creat a "images folder" in the "HTML-PERSONAL Site"
        folder. Then drag and drop image in the folder. Then create a path to that folder in between the quotations in the tag.
        by typing "image/" in front of the name of the picture (no space is needed). The image should go from square to
        circle because it is from mu folder and not a website. It's not working this way. -->

  type "My Hobbies". In the "body tag" part you can type your <h3></h3> heading say "Hobbies". under that you can make a <ol></ol> tag
  wit the <li></li> tag inside of it, and the <a href="URL OR LINK">NAME OF LINK OR VIDEO</a> inside the <li></li> for each of
  my hobbies (However, she used the "paragraph tag" under her <h1></h1> heading on her contact page, i guess just because it's straight
  text). An example of this is on my "Hobbies.html" Page. Then go back to the "index.html" page and create another "anchor" tag
  linking to the web page i just created. <a href="Hobbies.html">My Hobbies</a>. The example is right above for my Hobbies AND
